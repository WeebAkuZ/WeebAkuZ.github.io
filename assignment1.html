			<h1>The Red and White Blood Cells.</h1>
			
			<p> There are three main types of cells in your blood – <b>red blood cells, white blood cells</b> and <b>platelets</b>. This webpage will be discussing the main functions of the <i>Red</i> and <i>White</i> Blood cells. </p>
			
		  </header>
		  
		  <h3> What do the Red and White Blood Cells do? </h3>
		  
		  <p>  The <strong> Red blood cells </strong> <b>carry oxygen</b> from your <i>lungs</i> to all the cells in your <i>body</i>. <b>Inside</b> your red blood cells there is a protein called <mark>haemoglobin</mark> which helps carry the <em>oxygen</em>. <br> <strong> White blood cells </strong> help your body <b>fight infection</b>. They are part of your <mark>immune system</mark>.</p>

			<section> 
			
				<h3> About </h3> 
				
					<p> Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to your tissues. Your tissues produce energy with the oxygen and release a waste, identified as carbon dioxide. Your red blood cells take the carbon dioxide waste to your lungs for you to exhale. Red blood cells make up almost half of your blood. The lifespan of a red blood cell is around 120 days. </p>
				
					<h3> Where are Red Blood Cells made? </h3>
					
						<p> Red blood cells develop in your body’s soft bone tissue (bone marrow) and release into your bloodstream after they fully mature, which takes about seven days. </p>
						
					<h3> What do Red Blood Cells look like? </h3>

							<br> 
							<figcaption> <strong> Red blood cells are microscopic and have the shape of a flat disk or doughnut, which is round with an indentation in the center, but it isn’t hollow. </strong> </figcaption>	
						</figure>
						
						<p> Red blood cells get their bright red color from a protein that allows them to carry oxygen from your lungs and deliver it to other tissues in your body (hemoglobin). Red blood cells don’t have a nucleus like white blood cells, allowing them to change shape and move throughout your body easier. </p>
				
			</section>

			<section> <!-- Conditions and Disorders -->
			
				<h2> Conditions and Disorders </h2>
				
					<p>Red blood cell conditions have either a low or high red blood cell count.</p>
				
					<h3> Medical Conditions that Affect a Low Red Blood Cell Count. </h3>
					
						<ul> 
							<li> <b>Anemia</b>: Your blood carries less oxygen than normal and causes your body to feel cold, tired and weak. </li>
							<li> <b>Blood loss</b>: Your body loses more blood cells than it can produce. </li>
							<li> <b>Bone marrow disorder</b>: You experience damage to your bone marrow, where red blood cells form. <small>(eg. leukemia, lymphoma)</small>. </li>
							<li> <b>Cancer</b>: Certain cancers and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can affect the number of red blood cells your body produces.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<h3>  Medical conditions that Affect a High Red Blood Cell Count </h3>
					
						<ul> 
							<li> <b>Polycythemia vera</b>: A high red blood cell count causes your blood to thicken, leading to <em>heart attack</em> or <em>stroke</em>. </li>
							<li> <b>Congenital heart disease</b>: One or more structures in your heart is irregular due to not forming completely during fetal development. </li>
							<li> <b>Lung disease</b>: The tissue in your lungs scars due to emphysema, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis. </li>
							<li> <b>Hypoxia</b>: The oxygen level in your blood is low.</li>
							<li> <b>Carbon monoxide</b>: Smoking increases your chance of exposure to carbon monoxide. </li>
						</ul>
						
					<h4> Common Symptoms of Red Blood Cell Conditions </h4>

						<ul> 
							<li> Fatigue </li>
							<li> Muscle weakness </li>
							<li> Lack of energy </li>
							<li> Headache or dizziness</li>
							<li> Blurry vision </li>
							<li> Cold hands and feet </li>
						</ul>
						
					<h4> Taking care of your Red Blood Cells </h4>
						
						<p> You can maintain healthy red blood cells by eating a nutritious diet that’s full of vitamins and minerals like iron, B9 (folic acid) and B12, which includes: </p>

						<ul> 
							<li> Red meat (beef) and meat from the organs, like liver. </li>
							<li> Fish </li>
							<li> Leafy vegetables, like kale and spinach </li>
							<li> Lentils, beans and peas </li>
							<li> Nuts and dried berries </li>
						</ul>

			<h2> White Blood Cells (Leukocytes) </h2>
			
			<section> 
			
				<h3> About </h3>
				
					<p> White blood cells fight infection and are an important part of your immune system. They make up a very small part of your total blood (less than 1%) and are almost 3 times larger than red blood cells. White blood cells have a wide range of lifespans, from hours to years. There are 3 types of white blood cells: granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Each type has an important role. </p>
					
					<ul> 
						<li> There are 3 types of granulocytes:
							<ul> 
								<li> <b>Neutrophils</b> help fight bacterial and fungal infections </li>
								<li> <b>Basophils</b> are part of your body’s immune response. Their exact function isn’t well known. </li>
								<li> <b>Eosinophils</b> help fight infections caused by parasites.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Monocytes break down and remove foreign organisms and dying cells from your body. </li>
						<li> Lymphocytes make up your immune system </li>
					</ul>	
					
					<h4> Where are White Blood Cells made? </h4>
					
						<p> White blood cell formation occurs in the soft tissue inside of your bones (bone marrow). Two types of white blood cells (lymphocytes) grow in the thymus gland (T cells) and lymph nodes and spleen (B cells). </p>
						
					<h4> What do White Blood Cells look like? </h4>
					
						<figure>
							<img src="images/wbc.jpeg" width="300" height="170" title="Round shaped White blood cell in the blood stream." alt="Image of White Blood Cell"> 
							<br> 
							<figcaption> <strong> White blood cells are colorless but can appear as a very light purple to pink color when examined under a microscope and colored with dye. </strong> </figcaption>	
						</figure>
						
						<p> These extremely tiny cells have a round shape with a distinct center membrane (nucleus). White blood cells have the ability to change the shape because white blood cells can squeeze themselves in between other cells, to reach other, infected cells </p>
				
			</section>

			<section> <!-- Conditions and Disorders -->
			
				<h3> Conditions and Disorders </h3>
				
					<p>If you have a low white blood cell count, you are likely to get infections (leukopenia). If your white blood cell count is too high (leukocytosis), you may have an infection or an underlying medical condition like leukemia, lymphoma or an immune disorder.</p>
				
					<h4> Medical Conditions that White Blood Cell Count. </h4>
					
						<ul> 
							<li> <b>Lymphocytic leukocytosis</b> is an abnormally high number of lymphocytes </li>
							<li> <b>Lymphocytopenia</b> is an abnormally low number of lymphocytes </li>
							<li> <b>Neutropenia</b> is an abnormally low number of neutrophils </li>
							<li> <b>Neutrophilic leukocytosis</b> is an abnormally high number of neutrophils.</li>
						</ul>
												
					<h5> Common Symptoms of White Blood Cell Conditions </h5>

						<ul> 
							<li> Fever, body aches and chills. </li>
							<li> Wound that is red, swollen, oozes pus or won’t heal. </li>
							<li> Frequent infections </li>
							<li> Persistent cough or difficulty breathing.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<h5> Taking care of your White Blood Cells </h5>

						<ul> 
							<li> Take vitamins. </li>
							<li> Take antibiotics. </li>
							<li> Practice good hygiene to prevent infection </li>
							<li> Treat medical conditions where white blood cell disorders are a side effect. </li>
